# Unexpected Contract Trap

A Solidity smart contract trap designed to detect and alert on interactions with unexpected or unknown contracts. This trap is part of the Drosera security framework and implements the `ITrap` interface for monitoring blockchain activity.

## Overview

The `UnexpectedContractTrap` monitors contract interactions and triggers alerts when a wallet or system interacts with contracts that are not in its predefined whitelist of known, trusted contracts. This provides an early warning system for potentially malicious or unintended contract interactions.

## Use Cases

### 1. **Wallet Security Monitoring**
- **Scenario**: Monitor a personal or institutional wallet for interactions with unknown contracts
- **Benefit**: Prevents accidental interactions with malicious contracts, rug pulls, or honeypot tokens
- **Implementation**: The trap maintains a whitelist of trusted contracts and alerts when the wallet interacts with any contract not on this list

### 2. **DeFi Protocol Security**
- **Scenario**: DeFi protocols monitoring their users' interactions with external contracts
- **Benefit**: Early detection of users potentially falling victim to scams or interacting with malicious dApps
- **Implementation**: Protocols can integrate this trap to monitor their users and provide warnings about risky interactions

### 3. **Enterprise Blockchain Security**
- **Scenario**: Corporate blockchain deployments monitoring employee wallet activities
- **Benefit**: Ensures compliance with company policies about which contracts employees can interact with
- **Implementation**: IT departments can use this trap to enforce contract interaction policies and maintain security standards

### 4. **Multi-Signature Wallet Protection**
- **Scenario**: Multi-sig wallets monitoring proposed transactions for unknown contract interactions
- **Benefit**: Additional layer of security before executing transactions, allowing signers to review unknown contracts
- **Implementation**: Integration with multi-sig workflows to flag transactions involving unknown contracts for additional review

### 5. **Automated Security Systems**
- **Scenario**: Integration with automated security responses and incident management systems
- **Benefit**: Real-time alerts and potential automatic protective actions when suspicious activity is detected
- **Implementation**: Connect to alerting systems, pause mechanisms, or other automated security responses

### 6. **Compliance and Audit Trail**
- **Scenario**: Organizations requiring detailed audit trails of all contract interactions
- **Benefit**: Maintains comprehensive logs of all contract interactions and flags for compliance review
- **Implementation**: Regulatory compliance systems can use this trap to ensure all interactions are with approved contracts

### 7. **DEX and Trading Security**
- **Scenario**: Monitoring trading activities for interactions with potentially malicious token contracts
- **Benefit**: Protection against fake tokens, rug pulls, and other trading-related scams
- **Implementation**: Trading platforms can integrate this trap to warn users about unknown token contracts

### 8. **Smart Contract Firewall**
- **Scenario**: Acting as a firewall layer for smart contract ecosystems
- **Benefit**: Prevents interactions with blacklisted or unknown contracts at the protocol level
- **Implementation**: Other contracts can query this trap before allowing external contract calls

### 9. **Incident Response and Forensics**
- **Scenario**: Post-incident analysis to understand how malicious contracts were accessed
- **Benefit**: Helps trace the timeline and method of security breaches involving unknown contracts
- **Implementation**: Security teams can use historical data from this trap for forensic analysis

### 10. **Educational and Testing Environments**
- **Scenario**: Blockchain education platforms monitoring student interactions
- **Benefit**: Ensures students only interact with approved educational contracts and prevents accidents
- **Implementation**: Educational platforms can use this trap to create safe learning environments

## How It Works

### Data Collection (`collect` function)
- Maintains a list of known, trusted contract addresses
- Returns the current state of known contracts and the calling wallet address
- In production, this would likely read from on-chain storage or event logs

### Threat Detection (`shouldRespond` function)
- Compares new contract interactions against the whitelist of known contracts
- Triggers an alert if an unknown contract interaction is detected
- Returns detailed information about the detected threat including:
  - The wallet address involved
  - The unknown contract address
  - A descriptive alert message



## Configuration and Customization

To adapt this trap for specific use cases:

1. **Update Known Contracts List**: Modify the hardcoded addresses in the `collect()` function to match your trusted contracts
2. **Dynamic Whitelist Management**: Implement functions to add/remove contracts from the whitelist
3. **Severity Levels**: Add different alert levels based on contract risk assessment
4. **Integration Points**: Connect to external alerting systems, logging frameworks, or automated response systems

## Security Considerations

- **Whitelist Management**: Ensure the whitelist is properly maintained and updated
- **False Positives**: Consider legitimate new contract deployments that might trigger false alerts
- **Gas Costs**: Monitor gas costs for frequent whitelist checks
- **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls for whitelist management functions
